## My First Experience Using Cursor for BookHive:

What I Liked:

1. I found it incredibly helpful in speeding up development, especially when integrating Firebase and making changes directly within Cursor itself.
2. I improved my ability to write clear prompts and debug issues more efficiently, making the overall development process much smoother.
3. I enjoyed the creative freedom of simply providing direct requests and having the app generate code that aligned with my vision.

## Challenges / Issues:

1. Cursor sometimes generated incorrect file paths, which led to deployment errors I had to troubleshoot.
2. Setting up authentication was more complicated than expected, and I had to make additional tweaks beyond what Cursor initially provided.
3. Cursor didn’t always “remember” previous prompts, so I had to repeat instructions multiple times.

## Summary
Overall, as a first-time Cursor user, I found it to be a powerful tool that helped me build BookHive more efficiently. Despite some challenges, this experience gave me a lot more confidence in developing and deploying full-stack applications.
